# petstore-service
An example microservice which together with the example
[consumer](https://github.com/agilepathway/available-pets-consumer) and 
[contract](https://github.com/agilepathway/available-pets-consumer-contract)
repos demonstrates [consumer-driven contract testing](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html)

The microservice uses an 
[OpenAPI design-first approach](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-first-vs-code-first).

As this repository exists to demonstrate _consumer_-driven contract testing, a good place to start is the
[web app consumer's README](https://github.com/agilepathway/available-pets-consumer), which describes the workflow.
